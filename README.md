## ðŸš€ Elevator Pitch

**VisioVoice** is a Python-based AI project designed to help visually impaired individuals recognize familiar faces. Using facial recognition and audio feedback, it allows users to "see" whoâ€™s around them, restoring independence and enabling emotional connection.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

The idea began after witnessing a robotic hand controlled by neural signals at an ISEF event. That childhood spark grew into a mission to create accessible, life-enhancing AI. After mastering Python through Harvard's CS50P, I dedicated months to designing AI glasses that could restore independence to blind users.
